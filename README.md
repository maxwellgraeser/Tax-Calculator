# Tax Savings Calculator

This was just a simple project that I wrote to help for calculating how much money to put aside for taxes when you receieve a check. This is based
on the recommended guidline of 30% of total income.

To run simply run the tax.py file and it will create an income_data.json file in the folder it is in. This will store all of the income data, as well as the date of entry.
